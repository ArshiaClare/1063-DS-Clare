// ProgramName: Program Three - Survival of the Lucky
// Author: Arshia Clare

// Description: 
//The program lets the user enter in two values: random seed and multiplier.
//This program reads in from the input file called the 'animals.txt',
//then it stores the name into a doubly linked list(D.L.L).
//The D.L.L. lets the pointer to go back and forward in the list and it is circular. 
//Then it is reset. The program calls the input again, but this time to to do the problem solving.
//The length of each animal name is multiplied to the user given multiplier.
//Then it moves right if the number is even, or otherwise it goes left.
//Wherever it lands, then the animal is deleted and called in the main. 
//After all the deletes, there will be one animal name which is the winner.
//All the answer (outfile reduced to save paper&easier printing) including
//the order that the animals were deleted and the final winner is printed 
//in 'eliminated.txt'.
